<h2>Writing Your Own C++ String Package and a Simple Text to Speech
Program<br>
</h2>
</center>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<b>In this lab you will learn some C++ features such a operator
overloading. You
will&nbsp; implement your own String C++ class<br>
</b>
<h2>Part 1. Download the Initial Sources and Tests<br>
</h2>
1. Copy the initial file into
your
working directory and untar the file:<br>
<blockquote>
  <div style="margin-top: -3px; margin-bottom: -3px;"><font
 face="Courier New">cp /homes/cs240/2014Fall/lab7-cpp-tts/lab7-src.tar .<br>
  </font></div>
  <div style="margin-top: -3px; margin-bottom: -3px;"><font
 face="Courier New">tar
-xvf lab7-src.tar</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-top: -3px; margin-bottom: -3px;">
<h2 style="margin-top: -3px; margin-bottom: -3px;">Part 2. Implementing
Stack class</h2>
<br>
Implement the Stack class and make sure the TestStack runs correctly.
Run the testall script.<br>
<br>
</div>
<h2 style="margin-top: -3px; margin-bottom: -3px;">
Part 3. Implementing MyString class<br>
</h2>
<div style="margin-top: -3px; margin-bottom: -3px;"><br>
Modify the file "MyString.cc"
to implement your own MyString class that stores internally the string
as a C string. This class will make strng manipulation easier. See the
interface in MyString.h<br>
</div>
<br>
Your goal is to make all the tests that test the different methods. Run
the following tests:<br>
<br>
TestMyString test1<br>
TestMyString test2<br>
TestMyString test3<br>
TestMyString test4<br>
TestMyString test5<br>
TestMyString test6<br>
...<br>
TestMyString test11<br>
<h2>Part 4. Implement the Sound class</h2>
Implement the Sound class described in Sound.h and Sound.cc Use
the example in lab6 simple-gen.c as base. Write well structured code
with comments since it will be checked during your lab time.<br>
<h2>Part 5. Implementing Text to Speech <br>
</h2>
Write a program <br>
<br>
&nbsp; ./TextToSpeech phrase wavefile<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; ./TextToSpeech "Hello world" hello.wav<br>
<br>
that will generate the speech that corresponds to the phrase "Hello
world" using your own voice and it will write it in the file hello.wav.<br>
<br>
You will generate the text to speech as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Download the program "Audacity" from audacity.sourceforge.com</li>
  <li>Record with your own voice each of the folowing words and name
the file &lt;word&gt;.wav. Save them as WAV 16bit signed. Record just a
few words initially to test your program. Record the rest when you are
sure your program works correctly. Save them using the option
File-&gt;Export-&gt;wave 16bit signed.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time, good, to, the, person,
have, new, of, and, year, do, first, in, a, way, say, last, for, that,
day, get, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long, on, I, thing, make, great,
with, it, man, world, life, hand, part, child, eye, woman, place, work,
week.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Parse the phrase passed as argument into words. Discard all the
punctuation marks and change it to lower case. Using the Sound class
you wrote, read the
corresponding wav files for these words and append them into a
single sound. Write the resulting sound into the wavefile passed as
argument. If the word does not have a corresponding sound file skip it.
Write a silence of about .05secs between each word.</li>
</ul>
You will show your texttospeech program during the lab.<br>
<h2>Turning in Your Project</h2>
Follow these instructions to turnin lab7. Make sure to run the testall
script often since your lab will be graded using this script.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Login to your data acocunt.</li>
  <li>Change to the directory above <i>lab7-src.</i></li>
  <li>Type "<tt>turnin -c cs240 -p lab7 lab7-src</tt>"</li>
  <li>Type&nbsp; "<tt>turnin -c cs240 -p lab7 -v</tt>" to
make sure you have submitted the right files.</li>
</ol>
The deadline for this lab is Monday November 24th, 2014, 11:59pm.
