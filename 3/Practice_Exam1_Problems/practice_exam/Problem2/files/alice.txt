But I dont want to go among mad
people,Alice remarked.
Oh, you cant help that, said the Cat :
were all mad here. Im mad. Youre mad.
How do you know Im mad ? said Alice.
 You must be, said the Cat, or you
wouldnt have come here.
Alice didnt think that proved it at all ;
however, she went on: And how do you know
that youre mad ?
To begin with, said the Cat, a dogs not
mad. You grant that ?
I suppose so, said Alice.

Well, then, the Cat
went on, you see a dog
growls when its angry,
and wags its tail when its
pleased. Now I growl when
Im pleased, and wag my
tail when Im angry. Therefore
Im mad.
